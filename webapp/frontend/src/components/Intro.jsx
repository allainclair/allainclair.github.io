      Since my adolescence, I am a computer enthusiast; I was amazed by the internet,
      built some websites, played games, and met people from many places.
      Before the internet, your reach was too limited; after, unlimited. Since that time,
      I follow every day the path for becoming a better tech professional.
      I have a computer science background, and I have achieved great professional
      positions so far. I thank my family and all people responsible for this.
